\section{Problem 2 - Depletion Region}

\subsection*{a) Explain the \textit{depletion approximation}.}

The depletion approximation is the assumption of carrier depletion within W and neutrality outside W

\subsection*{b) Draw an illustration of the transition region in a $p^+-n$ junction.}

\subsection*{c) Use Poisson's equation to show that for a \( \mathrm{p}^{+}-\mathrm{n} \) junction, the contact potential is related to the width of the depletion region, \( W \), by}
\[V_{0}=\frac{1}{2} \frac{q}{\epsilon} N_{d} W^{2} .\]

if we continue from the equation from the previous problem:

\[V_0=\frac{1}{2}\frac{q}{\epsilon}N_dx_{n0}W\]

We can also calculate the penetration of the transition region into the n materials by
\[x_{n0}=\frac{WN_a}{N_a+N_d}\]

if assume that $N_a>>N_d$ then we get $X_{n0}\approx W$ and 

\[V_{0}=\frac{1}{2} \frac{q}{\epsilon} N_{d} W^{2} \]
