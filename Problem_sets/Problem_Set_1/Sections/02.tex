\section{Part 2: Effective Mass}

\subsection*{Problem 2}
I expect to find the electrons with the highest mobility in the conduction band minima $\Gamma$ as it has the highest curvature. This will give us tha least effective mass as
\begin{equation*}
    m*=\hbar^2 \frac{\partial ^E(k)}{\partial k^2}
\end{equation*}

\subsection*{Problem 3}

You cannot find information about the effective mass mass the effective mass are affected by the medium in which the electron it is traveling thru as well as the direction og the velovity in the medium as well.
