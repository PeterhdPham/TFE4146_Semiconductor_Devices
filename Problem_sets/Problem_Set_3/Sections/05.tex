\section{Problem 5 - Diffusion}
Consider figure \ref{fig:Drift'ndiffusion.png} showing a steady state hole distribution \( p(x) \), which is the result of an injection of holes at \( x=0 \). Assume the length of the bar is infinite and let the excess hole concentration at \( x=0 \) be denoted by \( \delta p(0)=\Delta p \).

\subsection*{a) State the steady state diffusion equation for holes and find the solution under the given assumptions.}

The steady state diffusion equartions for holes is

\begin{equation*}
    \frac{d^{2} \delta p}{d x^{2}}=\frac{\delta p}{D_{p} \tau_{p}} \equiv \frac{\delta p}{L_{p}^{2}} 
\end{equation*}

where $L_p\equiv \sqrt{D_p\tau_p}$ is called the hole \textit{diffusion lenght}. As we have steady state, we no longer need partial derivatives.  The solution to this equation has the form


\begin{equation*}
    \delta p(x) = C_1 e^{\frac{x}{L_p}}+ C_2 e^{-\frac{x}{L_p}}
\end{equation*}

as we expect the distrobution of excess holes to decay to zero for large values of x because of recombination, and $\delta p = \Delta p$ at $x=0$ we end up with
\begin{equation*}
    \delta p(x) = \Delta p e^{-\frac{x}{L_p}}
\end{equation*}

\subsection*{b) Calculate the probability that a hole injected at $x = 0$ will recombine in the infinitesimally small interval between $x$ and $x + dx$.}

The probability that a hole injected at $x = 0$ survives to $x$ without recombination is $\frac{\delta p(x)}{\Delta p}=e^{-\frac{x}{Lp}}$ From this we get

\begin{equation*}
    \frac{\delta p(x)-\delta p(x+d x)}{\delta p(x)}=\frac{-(d \delta p(x) / d x) d x}{\delta p(x)}=\frac{1}{L_{p}} d x
\end{equation*}

Thus the total probability that a hole injected at $x = 0$ will recombine in a given $dx$ is the product of the two probabilities:

\begin{equation*}
    \left(e^{-x / L_{p}}\right)\left(\frac{1}{L_{p}} d x\right)=\frac{1}{L_{p}} e^{-x / L_{p}} d x
\end{equation*}

\subsection*{c) Show that $L_p$ is the average distance a hole will diffuse before recombining.}

By using the averaging thechnique

\begin{equation*}
    \langle f(x)\rangle=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) P(x) d x
\end{equation*}

we get

\begin{equation*}
    \langle x\rangle=\int_{0}^{\infty} x \frac{e^{-x / L_{p}}}{L_{p}} d x=L_{p}
\end{equation*}
