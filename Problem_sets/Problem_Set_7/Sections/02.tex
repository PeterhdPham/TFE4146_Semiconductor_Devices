\section{Problem 2}
\textbf{Draw a simple schematic of a MOSFET with $\mathrm{n}^{+}$wells in a p-type substrate. The gate electrode is made of $\mathrm{n}^{+}$-polysilicon and is separated from the substrate by a thin $\mathrm{SiO}_2$ layer. Draw the corresponding band diagram from source to drain in the two scenarios}
